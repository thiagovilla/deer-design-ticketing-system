# Job Interview Project

This project is a full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. It serves as a coding exercise to demonstrate the ability to set up a modern web application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React
- **Directory**: `frontend`
- **Main Files**:
  - `public/index.html`: The main HTML file for the React application.
  - `src/App.js`: The root component of the React application.
  - `src/App.css`: Styles for the main App component.
  - `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application.

### Backend

- **Framework**: Express
- **Directory**: `backend`
- **Main Files**:
  - `src/app.js`: The entry point of the Express application.
  - `src/routes/index.js`: Defines application routes.
  - `src/controllers/index.js`: Contains controller methods for handling requests.
